# Human Browning capacity Index (HBI)
* Here, we developed two computational tools, which we call human browning capacity index (HBI) and absolute HBI (absHBI), for estimating the degree of browning and quantifying the thermogenic potential of human fats based on high-throughput sequencing data.

* HBI was designed to predict the degree of browning and thermogenic potential in human pre-adipocytes, adipocytes and adipose tissues. But if you have RNA-seq data with batch effects, you may try absHBI as an alternative choice.

# Usage
Download the files in HBI folder to your working directory, and load the functions
```r
source("HBI.R")
```
